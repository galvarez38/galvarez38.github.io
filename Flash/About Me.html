<div id="myself">
  <p> I was born in Manhattan, New York, and I was raised in Staten Island.  I'm the oldest of three children with two sisters. I started drawing since I was about 11. It began with just drawing maps of the country, detailed streets of New York.  the map that I did of New York, was as big as the small sized living room. I've graduated from Cutris High School in June of 97 and first went to college at NYC College of Technology in Brooklyn. I started back to school at BMCC at the Spring of 03 to take up Mutlimedia Arts. I want to work in the fields of Graphic Designs and hoping that the techniques that I've learned from school can get me started on the goals that I want to complete
