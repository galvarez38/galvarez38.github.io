    _____</span> British-American <span id="genre" data-prompt="genre">________</span> film and an
     adaptation of the 1853 memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup, a New York State-born 
     free African American man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C., in 1841 and sold into slavery. 
     He worked on plantations in the state of Louisiana for twelve years before his release. 
     The first scholarly edition of Northup's memoir, co-edited in 1968 by Sue Eakin and Joseph 
     Logsdon, carefully retraced and validated the account and concluded it to be accurate.</p>
     
     <p>This is the third feature film directed by <span id="name" data-prompt="name">__________</span>. The screenplay was written by 
     John Ridley. <span id="actor#1" data-prompt="actor#1">_________</span> stars as Solomon Northup. Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, 
     Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt and Alfre Woodard are all 
     featured in supporting roles. Principal photography took place in <span id="city-state" data-prompt="city-state">
     __________</span>from 
     June 27 to August 13, 2012. The locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: 
     Felicity, Magnolia, Bocage, and Destrehan. Of the four, Magnolia is nearest to the actual plantation 
     where Northup was held.</p>
     
     <p>12 Years a Slave received wide critical acclaim, and was named the best film of the year by 
     several media outlets. It also proved to be a box office success, earning over $140 million on 
     a production budget of $20 million. The film won <span id ="number" data-prompt="number">_________</span> 
     <span id="category1" data-prompt="category1">____________</span>, 
     <span id="category2" data-prompt="category2">_____________</span> for Nyong'o and <span id="category3" data-prompt="category3">_____________</span> for Ridley. It was awarded 
     the Golden Globe Award for 
     Best Motion Picture â€“ Drama, and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts recognized the film 
     with the Best Film and the Best Actor award for Ejiofor.</p>
